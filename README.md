# Computational-Physics
This is a repository of sample problems from a computational physics course, showcasing data science techniques and programming languages used to solve them. 

The PDF files are reports which I detail the results I see from my code and anaylze those results. I wrote these reports to complete various assignments for the course.

The .py files contain raw python code that I wrote and used for the analysis in the reports.
